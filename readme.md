# Worm Serial: Markov Generator

## Info

This project lets you generate random text based on the
[Worm web serial](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) by Wildbow. It DOES NOT
contain the full text, only a copy that has been decomposed into its composite words.

## Requirements:
 - pymarkovchain package (`pip install pymarkovchain`)
 - Python 3 (Python 2 will probably work; untested)

## Usage

1. Unzip the Markov chain database
2. Run your code: `python worm-markov.py`
